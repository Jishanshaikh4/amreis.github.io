Hi, I'm Alister Machado dos Reis, a 22-years old student from Porto Alegre, Brazil. I'm currently enrolled as a B.Sc. Student in Computer Science at the Federal University
of Rio Grande do Sul (my State in Brazil). I was also part of the BRAFITEC exchange program between the years of 2015 and 2017. It is one of the most
competitive exchange programs of my country.

As a part of this program, I was also enrolled at the INP Grenoble (Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble) in Grenoble, France. There, I was a student at the École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique et Mathématiques Apliquées de Grenoble (ENSIMAG). I was enrolled as an Information Systems Engineering student between 2015 and 2016, and later I was a student in the Master's Program in Data Science (2016-2017).

My exchange program entails a double degree, which means I'll be receiving degrees from both the Brazilian and French institutes.

I'm mostly interested in Reinforcement Learning these days, but it wasn't a part of my studies so I'm teaching myself and using these blog posts to build and share knowledge.

You can find me on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/AlisterMachado), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alistermachado/), [Github](https://github.com/amreis/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/porralister), and here is my [Resume](/assets/cv/CV_AlisterReis.pdf).

Hope you enjoy the content!
